Disease Name: Leaf Blight
Source: https://plantvillage.psu.edu/topics/grape/infos

Overview:
Leaf blight, also known as Isariopsis leaf spot, is a disease that commonly affects grape leaves. It can cause significant leaf damage and potential yield losses if left untreated. It is common in tropical and subtropical grapes, appearing late in the season. Cynthiana and Cabernet Sauvignon are susceptible to this pathogen.

Symptoms:
On leaf surface we will see lesions which are irregularly shaped (2 to 25 mm in diameter). Initially lesions are dull red to brown in color turn black later. If disease is severe this lesions may coalesce. On berries we can see symptom similar to black rot but the entire clusters will collapse. It is characterized by large, irregular spots that are initially red or brown, but turn black and brittle over time.

Causes:
Leaf blight is caused by the fungus Pseudocercospora vitis. This is a plant pathogen that affects the leaves of grapevines and other plants. It creates visible lesions or spots on the foliage, typically appearing as dark brown or angular patches with a yellowish halo, which can eventually lead to premature leaf drop if the infection is severe. The fungus spreads through spores that are dispersed by wind and rain, finding entry points on the leaf surface during moist conditions.

Treatments/Solutions:
Fungicides sprayed for other diseases in the season may help to reduce this disease. Apply fungicides containing iprodione, chlorothalonil, mancozeb, fludioxonil, or azoxystrobin at the first signs of infection. Also, practice sanitation by removing infected leaves or other plant parts. Open up the canopy, provide adequate spacing between plants, or use pruning to allow more air to circulate around the plant. Lastly, avoid using too many fertilizers, as this can actually make plants more susceptible to infection. 

Prevention:
Water the plant at its base, avoiding getting water on the leaves. Make sure to rake up and destroy fallen leaves before the first snowfall. This is because fallen leaves can actually carry the disease and re-infect the plant in the spring. Moreover, it is important to maintain plant vigor by fertilizing based on a soil test, protect tender plants during the winter, and control weeds.
