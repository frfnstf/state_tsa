# state_tsa

This has just the files with code in them.

These were the changes I made:
  login.py -- creates a login page where user can either log in with existing account or create a new one

under main.py:
- Instead of buttons, now there's a toggle menu that pops up on the side.
- I added a dashboard screen too

Here is a link to a youtube video with a screen recording of the overall app just so you could see how it looks: https://youtu.be/omUNHHKp3Dw
- it only mainly showed the login screens and dashboard
- I didn't really change anything to the detection part

This is the link to the code we used for regionals, in case you want to look at the old code: https://github.com/frfnstf/tsa_comp
